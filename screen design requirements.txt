Screen Design Requirements
1. Login Screen
Purpose: Authenticate users before accessing the app.
Fields:
UserId: Text input for user identification.
Password: Password input (masked).
Captcha: A simple CAPTCHA challenge (e.g., text input with a generated code or image).
Layout:
Centered form with fields stacked vertically.
Submit button below the fields.
Notes:
Will need backend integration for authentication (not yet prototyped, so weâ€™ll simulate success for now).
CAPTCHA will be a placeholder (e.g., text input) until a real implementation is added.
2. Home Screen/Dashboard
Purpose: Provide an overview of contracts and tasks after login.
Widgets:
Pie Chart - Total Contracts by Type:
Displays count of Global vs. Local contracts.
Drill-down: Clicking "Global" or "Local" navigates to the Contract List Screen filtered by type.
Score Card - Contracts Due in 5 Days:
Shows count of contracts in workflow with due dates within 5 days.
Drill-down: Clicking navigates to the Contract List Screen filtered by due date.
My Task List:
List with columns: Task Name, Task Description, Task Due Date.
No drill-down specified (yet).
Etc: Placeholder for additional widgets (to be defined later).
Layout:
Widgets arranged in a grid (e.g., Pie Chart and Score Card side-by-side, Task List below).
Data: Dummy JSON data to populate the widgets (defined below).
3. Contract List Screen
Purpose: Display a searchable, filterable list of contracts.
Attributes:
Contract ID: Hyperlink; clicking opens a new screen (TBD).
Contract Name: Text.
Scope: Global or Local.
Partner Name: Text.
Contract Status: Enum (e.g., Draft, In-Review, In Approval, Effective).
Contract Begin Date: Date.
Contract Countries: Multiple 2-digit codes (e.g., US, IN, UK, CN).
Contract Owner: Text (user name/ID).
Notes: Text.
Layout:
Table format with sortable columns.
Responsive design for multiple countries display (e.g., comma-separated or badges).
Notes:
Filters from Dashboard drill-downs (e.g., Global/Local, due in 5 days) will apply here.
