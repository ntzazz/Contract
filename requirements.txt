# **Contract Management Web App - Requirement Specification Document**

## **1. Project Overview**
The contract management web application is designed to streamline the lifecycle of contracts between organizations and their vendors, partners, and clients. It will provide a structured, secure, and intelligent system for contract creation, approval, tracking, compliance management, and analytics. The application will be multi-tenant, ensuring that multiple organizations can operate within the system while maintaining data isolation and customization capabilities.

## **2. Core Functionalities**

### **2.1 User Roles & Permissions**
To ensure controlled access, the system will implement a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** model. 
- Each tenant (organization) can define and manage custom roles.
- Users will be assigned specific permissions based on their role.
- An **Admin Console** will allow administrators to create, manage, and modify roles dynamically as business needs evolve.

### **2.2 Contract Creation & Management**
Efficient contract management is at the heart of the system. Users will be able to:
- **Create Contracts:** Generate contracts from predefined templates or draft custom agreements.
- **Upload & Store Contracts:** Upload contracts in PDF or document format, with auto-extraction of metadata.
- **Version Control:** Maintain and track different versions of contracts, including modifications.
- **Metadata Tagging:** Automatically extract and allow users to tag contracts with key attributes (e.g., contract type, start/end date, parties involved).

### **2.3 Approval Workflow**
To streamline contract approvals, the system will offer a **Configurable Approval Workflow**:
- Multi-level approval processes (e.g., internal review, legal review, stakeholder sign-off).
- Role-based approvals ensuring only authorized personnel can approve.
- Audit logs for tracking contract approvals and changes.
- **E-Signature Integration** (optional) to facilitate secure digital contract signing.

### **2.4 Notifications & Reminders**
Users will be notified about contract-related activities via:
- **Email Notifications:** Alerts for pending approvals, expiring contracts, and status changes.
- **In-App Notifications:** A real-time notification center within the web app.
- **Reminder System:** Configurable alerts for key dates such as contract expiration or renewal deadlines.

### **2.5 Audit Logs & Compliance**
To meet compliance and security standards, the application will log all key activities:
- Tracks actions such as contract creation, modifications, approvals, and rejections.
- Version control ensures users can see historical changes.
- **Compliance Alignment:** Adheres to GDPR and ISO 27001 regulations to ensure data privacy and security.

### **2.6 Search & Filtering**
A robust search mechanism will allow users to locate contracts easily:
- **Keyword Search:** Find contracts using relevant keywords.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Search by metadata fields such as contract status, parties involved, dates, contract value, etc.
- **AI-Powered Search:** Intelligent search that understands user intent and provides smart recommendations.

### **2.7 Reporting & Dashboard**
The system will provide **real-time analytics and reporting** capabilities:
- **KPIs Segmentation:** Reports based on contract metadata, approval timelines, expiration dates, user activity, etc.
- **Dashboard View:** A graphical representation of key contract insights.
- **Exportable Reports:** Users can generate and download reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).

### **2.8 External Contract Distribution**
For collaboration and external approvals, the system will provide:
- **Secure Access Links:** Users can generate and share time-limited, access-controlled links to external stakeholders.
- **Activity Logs:** Tracks when and how external users interact with the contract.

### **2.9 Activity & Task Scheduling**
To improve task management related to contracts:
- **Rule-Based Scheduling:** The system automatically generates tasks based on configurable business rules (e.g., "Create a renewal task 30 days before contract expiration").
- **Manual Task Creation:** Users can create and assign tasks manually, such as follow-ups or document updates.

### **2.10 AI-Powered Features**
The system will integrate AI capabilities to enhance contract management:
- **Contract Risk Analysis:** AI will analyze contract clauses and flag potentially risky terms or missing legal safeguards.
- **Obligation Extraction:** The system will automatically extract key contractual obligations and notify users.
- **Metadata Extraction:** AI will extract and categorize contract metadata upon document upload.

## **3. Multi-Tenancy Approach**
### **3.1 Hybrid Multi-Tenancy**
- **Critical contract data** will be stored in separate databases per tenant to ensure isolation and security.
- **Shared metadata** will be stored in a common database for efficient cross-tenant operations.

### **3.2 Tenant-Specific Customizations**
Each organization using the system will have the flexibility to:
- **Define Custom Workflows** to match their approval and review processes.
- **Implement Custom Branding**, including logos, colors, and email templates.
- **Configure Custom User Roles & Permissions** specific to their business structure.

### **3.3 Tenant Provisioning & Onboarding**
- **Automated Tenant Registration** with domain-based recognition (e.g., `clientA.myapp.com`).
- **Admin Dashboard** for tenant setup and configuration.
- **Trial Period or Usage-Based Billing** (if applicable) for new tenants.

## **4. Security & Compliance**
The application will implement industry-standard security practices:
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt contracts at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control:** Strict role-based permissions with tenant-level separation.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Automated backups to prevent data loss.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhances login security.
- **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Ensures fair resource usage per tenant to prevent abuse.

## **5. Technical Stack & Architecture**
### **5.1 Frontend**
- Angular for building a responsive, modern web interface.

### **5.2 Backend**
- **Node.js** for API and business logic.
- **Python** for AI-powered contract analytics and metadata extraction.

### **5.3 Database**
- **PostgreSQL** for structured contract metadata.
- **MongoDB** for document storage and unstructured contract data.

### **5.4 Hosting & Deployment**
- **Cloud-Agnostic Deployment** ensures flexibility across cloud providers.
- **Containerization with Docker & Kubernetes** for efficient scaling.

## **6. Performance & Scalability**
- **Load Balancing** to distribute tenant activity evenly.
- **Auto-Scaling Containers** to manage high-traffic tenants dynamically.
- **Tenant-Level Analytics** to provide performance insights for each organization.

## **7. Next Steps**
- Define API architecture and database schema.
- Develop UI/UX wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core functionalities.
- Expand features iteratively based on user feedback and business needs.
